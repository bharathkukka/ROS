# 🚀 Beginner ROS 2 Projects — Hands-On Learning Path

These four projects are designed to take you from **zero** to **building autonomous robot behaviors** in simulation. Each one focuses on specific ROS concepts, building on the previous.

## 1️⃣ The Smart Announcer 📢

*“Hello World” for ROS — learn the basics of node communication.*

**🎯 Project Goal**

* Create **two nodes**:

  * **Announcer** — Publishes `"Hello World"` repeatedly.
  * **Listener** — Subscribes to the message and prints `"Listener heard: Hello World"`.

**🔑 ROS Concepts You’ll Learn**

* Creating a **workspace** and **package**.
* Writing a **Publisher** node (Python/C++).
* Writing a **Subscriber** node.
* Using **standard message types**: `std_msgs/msg/String`.
* Running nodes with `ros2 run` and inspecting messages with `ros2 topic echo`.
* Viewing the system graph with **`rqt_graph`**.

## 2️⃣ The Simple Calculator Service 🧮

*Learn the request/response pattern for triggering robot actions.*

**🎯 Project Goal**

* Create a **calculator service** (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
* Build a **client node** that sends numbers & operation, then prints the result.

**🔑 ROS Concepts You’ll Learn**

* Defining a **custom Service** (`.srv` file).
* Writing a **Service Server** node.
* Writing a **Service Client** node.
* Using **Launch Files** to start multiple nodes together.

## 3️⃣ The Follow-the-Target Bot 🎯

*Get hands-on with simulation and coordinate frames (`tf2`).*

**🎯 Project Goal**

* Launch a **TurtleBot3** in Gazebo.
* Write a node to spin the robot in a circle.
* Create a **target coordinate frame** that stays in front of the robot as it spins.

**🔑 ROS Concepts You’ll Learn**

* Starting simulations in **Gazebo**.
* Publishing velocity commands to `/cmd_vel` with `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`.
* Broadcasting transforms with **`tf2`**.
* Visualizing frames & robot state in **RViz2**.

## 4️⃣ The Wall-Avoider Robot 🤖

*Your first autonomous behavior — combining sensing & control.*

**🎯 Project Goal**

* Make the robot drive forward autonomously.
* Use laser scan data to stop if an obstacle is detected ahead.

**🔑 ROS Concepts You’ll Learn**

* Subscribing to **real sensor data** (`/scan` topic with `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan`).
* Implementing **control logic** in callbacks.
* Publishing motion commands in the same node.
* Debugging live robot behavior in simulation.
